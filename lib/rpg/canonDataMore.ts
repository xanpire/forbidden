// Living-world Stage 2 (Nov 2026): more of the timeline. Pure data, merged
// into CANON_MILESTONES in canonData.ts (sorted by opening date there).
//
// - World events the timeline was missing: Kimimaro's illness, Root's last
//   test for Sai, Orochimaru's stopgap body, Jiraiya's reports, two deaths
//   the cast needs (Dosu, Raiga), Hashirama's history lesson in the war, the
//   post-war Hiden stories, and the births of the children the cast adds.
// - Personal beats for the long gaps, the Karin arc, Kan's failing eyes in
//   stages, the canon threads (the Naka Shrine tablet, Shisui's other eye,
//   the Uzumaki masks and Uzushio, the Seven Swordsmen's blades), and quiet
//   peacetime beats up to the Seventh Hokage.
//
// Checked against what the timeline already had: Zabuza and Haku against
// Kakashi are in "The dead march", Sasuke leaving on his journey is in
// "Sasuke's pardon", and Kan's own trial is "The reckoning".
